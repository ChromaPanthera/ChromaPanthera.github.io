            <h3>Teaching</h3>
            <p>
                Let's establish some things for consistency.<br>
                A topic is a subject, technique, or idea.<br>
                The student will be the person learning a topic.<br>
                The teacher is someone trying to teach the topic.<br><br>

                As the teacher, the goal is for the students to learn a topic, obviously.&ensp;
                Well, here's the big question.&ensp;
                What is learning?&ensp;
                The ability to recite facts?&ensp;
                Accumulating knowledge?&ensp;
                Passing trials related to a topic?&ensp;
                Gaining the ability to explain to others?&ensp;
                Guess what, none of the above.<br><br>

                I sound crazy, but here are some flaws to each idea.&ensp;
                Reciting facts?&ensp;
                That's just memorization, it's not a sign of intelligence.&ensp;
                When they come back to it after a month, how much would they know for a pop quiz?&ensp;
                Accumulation?&ensp;
                That's also not learning in an effective sense.&ensp;
                It's one thing to know about a topic, but it's different in application.&ensp;
                By knowing one concept, can they apply it to other similar situations?&ensp;
                Passing?&ensp;
                Get an A and bam, you are the best?&ensp;
                That's very subjective to the teacher and the students.&ensp;
                Do the questions maximize the knowledge and lessons?&ensp;
                Is it certain that they are proficient for anything, or did they get lucky with what was given?&ensp;
                The students who fail, does it mean they are ignorant or were there other factors that weren't considered beyond the result?&ensp;
                Explanation seems like it should be good indicator.&ensp;
                Here's the issue.&ensp;
                Are students teaching other students the correct information?&ensp;
                Is it certain they are not spreading misinformation?&ensp;
                These are some arguments that can be made of the different flaws.<br><br>

                Let's get the obvious out of the way.&ensp;
                There is no universal or optimized way to teach people, and the larger the group, the
                harder it becomes to teach.&ensp;
                So, now we can talk about the big question: what is my belief of good teaching.<br><br>

                Well, the answer centralizes on one idea, frustration.&ensp;
                Now, I know what you are thinking.&ensp;
                But C, if people are frustrated, they quit.&ensp;
                But here's the thing.&ensp;
                That's not a consistent result.&ensp;
                People do not give up immediately and accept that they will never do it all the time.&ensp;
                So why does this happen then?&ensp;
                The answer is a failure in the mentality.&ensp;
                They have accepted that no one, not even you, as the teacher, can help them because 
                they lack any constructive feedback, or the answer given fails to answer their
                concerns and raises even more questions that are left unanswered.&ensp;
                This is similar to an <b>aspect</b> of depression where the person feels that their
                situation won't improve no matter what they do.&ensp;
                Now, the part you are confused by, at this point.&ensp;
                If I want teachers to treat students like they are sick, why am I telling them to make
                students frustrated on the topic they are learning?&ensp;
                Well, my observant reader, this is where it becomes magical.&ensp;
                Also, congratulations on reading this far, you are exceeding my expectations for reading
                my poorly written thoughts and mildly contradicting philsophy.&ensp;
                The magical thing is that by allowing students to feel frustrated and question aspects 
                of the topic.&ensp;
                Through that frustration, they will pose a challenge that will create a core aspect of
                a good learning environment, discussions.&ensp;
                But the key thing is that students are thinking.&ensp;
                <br>

                I will outline the teaching cycle with frustration as the core: preparation, opening, 
                touring, interrogation, and finally encourage, or POTIE<br>

                In the <strong>preparation</strong> stage, teachers must prepare two things.&ensp;
                A script and a choreography.&ensp;
                Now a script makes sense, a teacher has limited time so they need to give a lesson 
                clearly and concisely without second guessing themselves.&ensp;
                However, the script isn't just about the lesson itself.&ensp;
                It is also about having lures to encourage questions and having answers to them, and
                to also break monotony.&ensp;
                One of the worst things to happen is for students to tune out your lesson because it 
                became boring to hear your voice.&ensp;
                So, the teacher must also fit in places where they express jokes, point out something
                ridiculous, or a breakpoint to allow for other activities.&ensp;
                Now the confusing one.&ensp;
                Why choreography?&ensp;
                Obvious answer, stand somewhere where the material isn't obstructed.&ensp;
                BORING!&ensp;
                Here's a bigger reason.&ensp;
                Some people don't write their notes&ensp;
                They listen to the voice or record audio.&ensp;
                In those cases, you need something for them to latch their eyes to which will be you.&ensp;
                Even if they are reading what is being written, the time that was meant for writing, is now
                pointed towards the sole focus and potential interesting idea in the room.&ensp;
                What does it mean?  
                The teacher will need to use themselves through movements to portray the lesson.&ensp;
                Nothing unnecessary like objects, exaggerated movements, or loud noises.
                Just movements that emphasize what you are showing or expressing.<br><br>

                In the <strong>open</strong> stage, the teacher needs to establish an open platform for people to ask
                questions.&ensp;
                How does it work?&ensp;
                Well, the teacher needs to publicize two ideas.<br>
                1. No question is irrelevant.<br>
                2. It's ok to ask a silly question.<br>
                Both seem obvious at first, but in practice, it is not followed.&ensp;
                For instance, how many people seem to have similar questions or relied on finding 
                teachers after classes for questions?&ensp;
                So, how does one set up an open platform?&ensp;
                Well, it's quite simple.&ensp;
                Ask an open ended question to the class related to the topic which sounds ridiculous 
                or relates to the student interest.&ensp;
                Now, it can't be a question with an obvious answer, nor should it be completely 
                shocking for the sake of shock value.&ensp;
                The best questions are those that foreshadow a lesson or provide a different angle of
                perspective while sounding unconventional.<br><br>

                In the <strong>touring</strong> stage, the teacher goes through the lesson they made in the preparation.&ensp;
                What is put to the test here is not how well the lesson can be executed.&ensp;
                Rather, it is about adapting the lesson on the fly.&ensp;
                A core fundamental to this is reading the students.&ensp;
                When you first meet them, it will be difficult.&ensp;
                After all, they are a stranger you are forced to meet.&ensp;
                Now a teacher cannot ask the student about themselves nor call out students.&ensp;
                It is unncessary and goes against the principles of the open stage.&ensp;
                By committing to either tactic, the teacher alienates other students and could intimidate
                the student in question.&ensp;
                In the long run, the authority of a teacher will diminish.&ensp;
                So go through a lesson, read the students after a few minutes, and adjust your plans to 
                accommodate the situation.<br><br>

                In the <strong>interrogation</strong> stage, it is the hardest and probably the least rewarding part.&ensp;
                The goal is to check if the student followed the lesson and understood any implications
                or connections.&ensp;
                Why do I say it's the least rewarding?&ensp;
                The simple answer.&ensp;
                Students likely won't respond to a question.&ensp;
                They need time to digest a lesson so it is near impossible to see any progress until the 
                next lesson.&ensp;
                Another issue that arises is when the teacher misjudges the students.&ensp;
                When it happens, the question itself will undo progress in the open stage.&ensp;
                I will talk about how to reopen it when it happens later.&ensp;
                So, now we can talk about why it's the hardest.&ensp;
                A good question will be easy to follow and lacks ambiguity.&ensp;
                That isn't say it only has 1 answer.&ensp;
                Rather, it should be open to interpretations or ideas that seem counterproductive.&ensp;
                Remember that the key essence is not about being right or wrong.&ensp;
                It is about expanding ideas or factually correcting answers which have deviated from the
                reality.&ensp;
                This would mean that the last answer the teacher should tell them is "no, that's wrong" 
                unless it is for certain incorrect in all aspects.&ensp;
                In cases like those, teachers should give a valid reason why the idea is wrong and 
                encouragement for the attempt.&ensp;
                If the teacher lacks a reason, they should hear out the student about their ideas.&ensp;
                Now, the issue from earlier.&ensp;
                What happens if students closes up?&ensp;
                The least productive follow-up question would be "Is there something that doesn't make
                sense" because the teacher would not know where the students are lost.&ensp;
                Furthermore, students who were following are likely thinking harder to figure out where
                it went wrong.&ensp;
                This is where the teacher will propose options to figure out where things go wrong.&ensp;
                Will it waste time?&ensp;
                Absolutely.&ensp;
                Will it be worth it?&ensp;
                50/50.&ensp;
                Regardless, the teacher must still ask question and judge how much they know.<br><br>

                The last and final stage, <strong>encouragement</strong>.&ensp;
                Very simple, very straightforward.&ensp;
                The least productive is to tell them, "good work today".&ensp;
                Wait what?&ensp;
                Teachers should not congratulate the students on learning today?&ensp;
                Yes, that's what I'm saying.&ensp;
                Instead, the lesson will end on two notes.&ensp;
                Either, they will congratulate students for asking questions or adding to discussions.&ensp;
                Or teachers share resources to further reinforce what they learned as well as 
                provide potential answers.&ensp;
                The first is all about reward students regardless of right, wrong, ease, or difficulty
                of asking.&ensp;
                The second is all about trying to indirectly answering questions for students who are
                shy or have difficulty expressing verbally.&ensp;
                In both cases, it's about driving them to be curious and to think as they work.<br><br>

                Now, the advice to the teacher.<br>
                1. Never be lazy: laziness leads to slop, slop damages quality, quality establishes trust.<br>
                2. Listen to ideas: do not close opportunity, challenge the ideas.<br>
                3. Let chaos happen: create rivalry, let them sharpen each other to become better.<br>
                4. Observe: watch, learn, grow, improve.<br>
                5. Be flexible: never assume things will go as planned.<br>
                6. Become the obstacle: be the ultimate challenge for students to surpass.<br>
                7. Never generalize: everyone is different, so to must the teacher accept that.<br>

            <h3>Coding Practices</h3>
            <p>
                I hate having code that nobody understands.&ensp;
                Why should people use something proactively if no one understands how it works?&ensp;
                Think about it.&ensp;
                History tells us that when people start using miracle inventions, there are unexpected
                consequences.&ensp;
                The X-ray was a revolutionary invention but the inventor didn't know about radiation which
                led to their early death along with others.<br>

                I like multipurpose code modules.&ensp;
                Obviously, it saves time for future programs.&ensp;
                It also makes debugging easier and improves older programs.<br>

                I hate the quality in automated processing.
                Nowadays, there are ways for people to avoid talking to a representative.&ensp;
                On the side of banks, there are ATM's, <br>

                I like debugging errors.&ensp;
                Mistakes are always part of the process.&ensp;
                Find the problem, add it to the list of things that can go wrong in the future.&ensp;
                It's also good mental exercise to problem solving and tracking.<br>

                I hate data-oriented AI.&ensp;
                Data itself isn't a bad thing to have.&ensp;
                It helps people understand why things happen or if there are patterns.&ensp;
                Not only that, data can also be used to gain opinions of your own work.&ensp;
                However, AI attempts to analyze and create answers for the user.&ensp;
                Initially, it's not a bad idea but there are severe issues.&ensp;
                One of the biggest is that it stunts growth.&ensp;
                Think about it.&ensp;
                Thousands of data from everyday users from all walks of life are fed into an AI
                algorithm to be used as a baseline.&ensp;
                It takes a query from a user and scans its database for anything related
                to the words given.&ensp;
                Then it will take the best elements and data and stitched them all together for the 
                user.&ensp;
                The more data it has, the more diverse the results can become.&ensp;
                What gets problematic is not the flaws, it is originality.&ensp;
                Remember, the AI composes its results from previous works.&ensp;
                For an extreme example, let's say the AI only has the Mona Lisa in its database for 
                human.&ensp;
                If any input was made related to people, it would strongly resemble or be 
                identical to the Mona Lisa.&ensp;
                <br>
                

                I like UI with ease of use<br><br>

            <h3>The Food Debate</h3>
            <p>
                It's purely preference.  Not everyone will like the same thing.<br><br>
                Cake or pie?  Cake.  I won't refuse pie though.<br>
                Pineapple on pizza?  Yes.  It's pretty tasty.<br>
                Crispy or chewy cookies?  Crispy.  Not dry though.  There's a difference.<br>
                Regular or diet soda?  Regular.  I do usually prefer less sugar though.<br>
                Cereal or milk?  Cereal because I don't put milk in it.<br>
                Rice or noodles? Rice, obviously. <br>
                Sweet or savoury?  Tough one.  Probably Savoury.<br>
                Burger or hotdog?  Burger, I like beef.<br>
                Dip fries in milkshake?  Unsure, need to try first.<br>
                Steak doneness?  Medium rare.  I like some pinkness in the meat.<br>
                Pouring or dipping in ketchup?  Dip.  More even usage of ketchup.<br>
                Licking or biting ice cream?  Bite.  I don't have an excuse.<br>
                Pizza crust or na?  Ya!  I like the bready crust.<br>
                Fresh or leftover pasta?  Leftover for me.<br>
                Games or shows?  Games.  I do enjoy well-written cartoons.
